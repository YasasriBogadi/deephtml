                <h2>Our Deep Fake Detection Project</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to our Deep Fake Detection platform, a powerful tool designed to combat the rise of 
                    fake media. Our solution utilizes cutting-edge deep learning technologies, including 
                    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ResNet models, to analyze videos and images for signs 
                    of manipulation. With this platform, users can easily detect deep fakes with high accuracy, 
                    ensuring authenticity and trust in the digital world.

                <h2>How We Developed It</h2>
                <p>
                    Our development process combined LSTM for sequence-based data analysis and ResNet, a 
                    robust convolutional neural network, for image recognition. This hybrid deep learning model 
                    allows for the detection of both subtle and complex manipulations, giving our tool a strong 
                    edge over traditional detection methods.
